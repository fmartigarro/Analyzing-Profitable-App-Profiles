# Analyzing-Profitable-App-Profiles
Analyzing sample data from the Google Play Store and App Store to find the profiles of profitable apps.

If I were to develop a free application with the goal of maximizing users, what type of application should I develop?
This project attempts to answer this question by analyzing sample data from the Google Play Store and App Store. 

By the end of the project, I will have:
  1) clarified the goal of the project
  2) collected relevant data
  3) cleaned data to prepare it for analysis
  4) analyzed the cleaned data
  
I hope you enjoy reading my project and seeing how I go through the data science workflow!
